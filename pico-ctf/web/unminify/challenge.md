## Description
> I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it.
 
>As a bonus, my pages load faster! Browse here, and find the flag!

## Solution
- This challenge title refers to the minification of code,this happens mostly in javascript and html for obsufication and hiding functions of code.
- All we had to do here, if we were to follow a structured procedure, was to load the html code in a deobsification tool and inspect, a quick google search and we get this site [Unminify](https://unminify.com/), it organizes the code in a way that is easier to inspect and find the flag
- ... What are you waiting for???... Yeah that's all DIY ;p
