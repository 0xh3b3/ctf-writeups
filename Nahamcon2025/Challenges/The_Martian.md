## Solution
The first step was enumeration and finding out what kind of file the eliens use, I ran file challenge.martian command and discovered that it was a data file

next I ran binwalk to extract hidden data
```binwalk -e challenge.martian```

Several files were extracted, I ran ```file *``` command to identify their file type, one file stood up in particular called `34` and `957D`, they were both images and they contained the flag 

![alt](cat.png)

I added the file type prefix, scaled the image using magick convert tool
```convert 957D.png -resize 200% flag.png```

and then extracted the text using tesseract
```tesseract 957D.png flag```

> `flag{Odb031ac265b3e6538aff0d9f456004f}`
